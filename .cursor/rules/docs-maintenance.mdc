# Documentation Maintenance

When changing feature behavior or architecture, check `docs/` for
existing documentation on the affected topic.

1. Run `ls docs/` to see what documentation exists.
2. If a relevant doc exists, read it and update it to reflect your
   changes.
3. If you are adding a new feature with no existing doc, create one
   in `docs/` covering: feature intent, engineering scope, testing
   strategy, and performance implications.

Do not skip this step. Undocumented changes are incomplete changes.
