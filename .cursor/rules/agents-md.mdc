# AGENTS.md

At the start of every session, READ `AGENTS.md` at the repository root
using the Read tool. It contains:

- Core principles and workflow orchestration rules
- Repository map and ownership boundaries
- Testing requirements and linter commands
- Practical do/do-not lists
- References to `docs/coding-rules.md` for hard coding rules

Follow all instructions in that file. Do not rely on memory from
previous sessions -- the file may have been updated.
