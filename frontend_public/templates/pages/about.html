                                    We came together over a shared excitement about building a product that could solve a problem dear to our hearts. But also a product that helps teams of cave explorers and surveyors to map the underground world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Underwater Speleological and Archaeological Heritage Institute (USAH Institute) was founded with a mission to enhance collaboration and innovation in the field of cave survey and data collection. Recognizing the challenges faced with the tools (often outdated) used by our community, proprietary file formats, and a lack of collaborative platformsâ€”we set out to create a solution that addresses these issues while respecting the deep-seated concerns about data privacy and ownership.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our journey began with the realization that the cave survey community needed a modern, open-source platform that prioritizes data integrity and collaboration. Inspired by proven solutions in other fields, such as GIT for version control and open-source governance, we envisioned a platform that would empower users to take full control of their data. Thus, SpeleoDB was born.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    From the outset, our goal was to build a platform that is not only technologically advanced but also transparent and inclusive. SpeleoDB leverages open file format standards to ensure compatibility across different software, and our open-source code invites scrutiny and contributions from the community. We believe that a collaborative approach is essential for the platform's continuous improvement and alignment with the community's needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As we move forward, we remain committed to a decentralized future. With the development of the SpeleoPUB protocol, we aim to enable users to run their own servers, fostering a truly distributed network that enhances both collaboration and data security. Our technical steering committee, comprising members from various backgrounds within the cave survey community, ensures that the evolution of SpeleoDB is guided by collective wisdom and shared goals.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At SpeleoDB, we are driven by our dedication to innovation, transparency, and community. Our story is one of collaboration and progress, as we work together to transform the landscape of cave survey and data collection for the good of the cave diving communities.
