# Agent Documentation Index

This directory contains LLM/agent-focused technical documentation.

Unlike product docs, these files prioritize:

- engineering intent and invariants
- architecture boundaries and extension points
- expected test coverage
- performance constraints and anti-patterns

## Topics

- `map-viewer/depth-domain-reactivity.md`
  - depth color mode architecture, cache model, and performance rationale
- `map-viewer/map_viewer_depth_coloring.md`
  - markdown conversion of `docs/map_viewer_depth_coloring.rst` for agent usage
- `map-viewer/permissions-and-access.md`
  - centralized permission model and scope-routing behavior
- `map-viewer/testing-and-quality.md`
  - frontend test map, validation commands, and regression checklist
